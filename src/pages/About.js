              Hi, it's Shreshthav. I am a Indian software engineer and MERN
              Developer from Delhi/Indian. First of all, thank you for reading
              my blog. It's such a pleasure to have you here!
            </p>
            <p>
              A couple of words about my professional life: I am a Indian
              software and web developer dedicated to learning JavaScript. After
              obtaining my Bachlor's Degree in computer science, I gained
              experience from the startup world where I used JavaScript
              intensively during both my professional life and spare time. For a
              few years, I Learned javascript and its framework like React js
              and angular , developing large-scale JavaScript applications,
              which eventually led to a desire to learn more others about these
              topics.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time as a developer in India, I read articles about web
              development on my website. I received great knowledge from people
              thoughts and ideas which allowed me to improve my writing coding
              style. Article after article, I grew my ability to code. I find it
              it fulfilling to see myself strive by taking clear objectives
              about web development
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am a self-employed developer creating large-scale
              JavaScript applications to improve my skills as good as possible.
              You can find more information about me, ways to support me, and
              share your work with me in the next sections.

              , but Iâ€™m always struggling to memorize my learnings. I guess,
              that's why I started to write down my notes of books I enjoyed to
              read. But it's difficult to keep up with all the books. Nowadays I
              often encourage people to read more, because it's such a
              fulfilling and meaningful activity.

              I invest a lot of my free time into this website. Several hours a
              working week and most of my weekend time. That way, I hope that I
              can help others to learn the things that I have learned by myself.
              But I cannot deny that it costs a lot of time and energy to keep
              the website up and running. As a return of investment, I get
              revenue from{" "}

              and a little affiliate marketing, but that's nothing compared to
              the time and energy I put into it. Sometimes I wonder how much
              easier it would be to quit, but then my readers encourage me to
              keep going. I think it applies to everything in life: people have
              a big impact on this when they cheer you up.

              Requests to improve the articles. It is not easy to keep
              everything up to date being all by myself. Additionally, it is not
              easy as a non native speaker.

              In addition, you can write a guest blog post. Do you have an own
              website? Do you write quality content? Do you want to get more
              readers to your website? My website generates lots of traffic. You
              can help a lot of people in your topic of choice by teaching them.
              A guest blog post that links to your website is a great
              contribution. It has to relate to my content though.

              What I Use
            </h2>
            <p>
              The following is a selection of my tools that I use for my
              professional work. The links to the resources can be affiliate
              links or referral links. The former give me some provision, the
              latter provides you and me with a discount to a service or
              product. So most of the time it's a win-win situation and these
              affiliate links are one way to support me being self-employed.
              However, most importantly I hope that these resources help you to
              build your business.

              powers all my websites, APIs and applications by using only 3
              Droplets (each $5 month). I believe one droplet would be
              sufficient, but I like to separate them by domain.
