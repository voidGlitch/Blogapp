              Hi, it's Shreshthav. I am a Indian software engineer and MERN
              Developer from Delhi/Indian. First of all, thank you for reading
              my blog. It's such a pleasure to have you here!
            </p>
            <p>
              A couple of words about my professional life: I am a Indian
              software and web developer dedicated to learning JavaScript. After
              obtaining my Bachlor's Degree in computer science, I gained
              experience from the startup world where I used JavaScript
              intensively during both my professional life and spare time. For a
              few years, I Learned javascript and its framework like React js
              and angular , developing large-scale JavaScript applications,
              which eventually led to a desire to learn more others about these
              topics.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time as a developer in India, I read articles about web
              development on my website. I received great knowledge from people
              thoughts and ideas which allowed me to improve my writing coding
              style. Article after article, I grew my ability to code. I find it
              it fulfilling to see myself strive by taking clear objectives
              about web development
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am a self-employed developer creating large-scale
              JavaScript applications to improve my skills as good as possible.
              You can find more information about me, ways to support me, and
              share your work with me in the next sections.

              . Every time I build a product/service for myself, I immediately
              think about how to open source it for others. Even though I open

              , but Iâ€™m always struggling to memorize my learnings. I guess,
              that's why I started to write down my notes of books I enjoyed to
              read. But it's difficult to keep up with all the books. Nowadays I
              often encourage people to read more, because it's such a
              fulfilling and meaningful activity.
